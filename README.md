# Conway's Game of Life

A fun implementation of Conway's Game of Life built in C using raylib.

## Features

### âœ… Completed
- **Sparse representation** - Efficient memory usage for large grids
- **Game logic** - Core Conway's Game of Life rules implementation
- **Cell rendering** - Visual display of living cells
- **Simple multithreading** - Basic parallel processing

### ðŸš§ Todo
- **Complex multithreading** - Advanced parallel computation
- **More interactive experience** - Enhanced user interaction features

## Getting Started

This project uses C and raylib for graphics rendering.

## About Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells live, die, or reproduce based on simple rules:
- Any live cell with 2-3 live neighbors survives
- Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
- All other cells die or remain dead
